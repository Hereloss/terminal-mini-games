# Terminal Mini-Games
This is still a work in progress - some of the games work fully, some do not! Quest and Poker are currently still in development, but Quest will still run - just might do some things a bit strangely! Poker will not run yet - 2 player capabilities are being added
## About each game
Cocktail Roulette - Just state what drinks you've got, and this will give you a cocktail to try with them!
Grandparadox - a 2 player game where one player tries to kill Grandad, and the other tries to save him!
Guesser - a simple guessing game, just try to work out what number the computer has!
Quest - the start of an RPG Quest game - try to win the Colloseum games!
Poker - currently a 1 player poker game, the 2 Player support currently being added
Maze - Will generate a random maze, and you need to try to get out! The exit is the one next to the top left corner.
## Process of creating
Created as multiple mini-games, and compilied into one single launcher. Chess is being created as a separate app but may be incorportated later. Further games to be added are Draughts and Sudoku.
## Getting started
To get started, just simply load up the game and select the minigame you'd like to play!
